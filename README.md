# Fun Drum

**Fun Drum** is an interactive web application that lets you play different drum sounds by either clicking on the drums or pressing specific keys on your keyboard. The website features 7 drum instruments and is a fun way to practice and explore sound with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **7 Drum Instruments**: Each drum produces a unique sound when clicked.
- **Keyboard Support**: Each drum is also mapped to a key (`W`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `J`, `K`, `L`), allowing you to play sounds using the keyboard.
- **Interactive Design**: Buttons display the corresponding keys on them for easy access.

## Usage

1. **Click on Drums**: Click on any drum on the screen to hear the sound.
2. **Press Keys**: Press the keys (`W`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `J`, `K`, `L`) on your keyboard to play corresponding drum sounds.
3. **Enjoy**: Have fun creating beats and rhythms with the drums!
